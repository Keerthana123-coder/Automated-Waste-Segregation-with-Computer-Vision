♻️ Automated Waste Segregation with Computer Vision
📌 What is this project?

This project is a deep learning–based waste classification system that automatically identifies waste items as Organic or Recyclable using computer vision.

📦 What I am developing

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Kaggle Waste Classification Dataset.

Image upload testing in Google Colab (predicts category for single images).

Real-time webcam prediction (run locally in VSCode) that shows a message:

"Put in: Organic Bin"

"Put in: Recyclable Bin"

🎯 Purpose

To support sustainable waste management

To improve awareness of recycling practices

To provide a simple and efficient AI-powered waste segregation tool
