‚ôªÔ∏èAutomated-Waste-Segregation-with-Computer-Vision

Project Description

This project implements an AI-powered waste classification and segregation system using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
It classifies waste items into Organic or Recyclable, and uses hand gesture recognition for virtual interaction with colored dustbins displayed on screen.
The system is designed for real-time execution .

üîπ Improvements Over Existing Projects

Most existing waste classification projects stop at static image classification.
This project introduces several unique improvements:

1Ô∏è‚É£ From Static to Real-Time

supports live webcam classification for real-time waste detection.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Gesture-Controlled Virtual Bins

builds a visual dustbin interface and allows gesture-based interaction without mouse/keyboard.

3Ô∏è‚É£ User-Friendly GUI

interactive on-screen 2D dustbins with prediction highlights, making it educational & user-friendly.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Integration of Computer Vision + Deep Learning

 combines CNN classification with OpenCV & MediaPipe for gesture control.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Scalability & Real-World Usability
 modular pipeline that can be extended to more waste types, IoT-based sorting bins, or even robotic integration.
