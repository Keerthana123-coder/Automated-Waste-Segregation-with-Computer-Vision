♻️Automated-Waste-Segregation-with-Computer-Vision
  Project Description

This project implements an AI-powered waste classification and segregation system using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
It classifies waste items into Organic or Recyclable, and uses hand gesture recognition for virtual interaction with colored dustbins displayed on screen.
The system is designed for real-time execution .
